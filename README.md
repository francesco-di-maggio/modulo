# modulo

A Toolkit for Tinkering with Digital Musical Instruments. 

## About 

Think of it as a LEGO set for your musical ideas. Each module is designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, where core functionalities (and patching) are housed within a compact and user-friendly interface. You can mix, match, customize and extend your own musical tools in a modular and multichannel workflow.

## Architecture

```modulo``` is a modular ecosystem that allows the user to seamlessly interchange bespoke sound and modulation stages for rapid prototyping of digital musical instruments. Each module represents a building block in the processing chain. The system consists of different types of modules, from input signal generators to control processing algorithms such as smoothing, calibrating and scaling, sound synthesis and output routers. These modules are presented with an adjustable user-friendly GUI, making it easy to access main control parameters and settings. Moreover, to streamline the patching experience, all modules share the same logic of "one-cable" patching, eliminating the hassle of connecting multiple input and output cables.

### Modules

While the toolkit focuses on acquiring, processing and mapping input data to sound, the routing and utility modules make it easy to connect to different workflows and external sound synthesis tools.

- [```input```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/input) modules capture, display and map input data, such as pads, sliders, and computer keyboard input.

- [```route```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/route) modules interface with external devices, including Max internal routing, MIDI, OSC, and Euroracks. 

- [```transform```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/transform) modules process signals via different algorithms, including filtering, averaging and smoothing.

- [```utility```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/utility) modules can handle auxiliary functions, such as mixing, visualising and recording input data.

### List & Multichannel

Modules can transmit data as ```list``` of control signals or ```multichannel``` audio signals, where data is normalized within a bipolar (```-1. - 1.```) / unipolar (```0. - 1.```) range of floating-point numbers to simplify communication with subsequent modules. Since each device allows a different set of input channels, each module is designed to automatically adapt to the number of input channels. 

* Please note that the Max DSP has to be restarted (turned off and on) to update the number of channels.

### Abstractions & Bpatchers

Users can combine two different methods of patching:

1. *Abstractions* (with objects exposed): Each module is instantiated in the main patcher window as an abstraction, where the main parameters can be modified using the appropriate message (e.g. ```mute 1```).

2. *Bpatchers* (with GUI exposed): Each module is instantiated as bpatchers, which exposes the main control parameters in the top level Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Preset

Key parameters are internally â€œbound" to a ```pattr``` object using a consistent namespace. This means that the ```preset``` object can be used together with ```pattrstorage``` to save and recall a snapshot of any parameter in a patcher window.
