# modulo
A Toolkit for Tinkering with Digital Musical Instruments. 

## About 
Think of it as a **Lego** set for your musical ideas. Each module is designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, where core functionalities (and patching) are housed within a compact and user-friendly interface. You can mix and match, customize, and extend your own musical tools in a modular and multichannel workflow.

## Installation

If you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, you can clone this repo via Terminal using the following commands:

	cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo

If not, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo). After decompressing the zip archive, the resulting folder must be placed in the Max search path, preferably in the following path:
