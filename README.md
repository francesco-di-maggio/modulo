# modulo

A Toolkit for Tinkering with Digital Musical Instruments. 

## About 

Think of it as a "Lego" set for your musical ideas. Each module is designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, where core functionalities and patching are housed within a compact and user-friendly interface. You can mix, match, customize, and extend your own musical tools in a modular and multichannel workflow. Happy patching!

## Architecture

### Modularisation of Max objects

Each module is a wrapper around a specific Max object (e.g. ```mo.snapshot~``` > ```snapshot~```), where core control parameters are displayed at the top level in the main GUI. This allow users to flexibly interchange modules for quickly prototyping different digital musical instruments. 

### Modules

- [```input```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/input) modules generate, display and map input data, such as pads, sliders, and computer keyboard input.

- [```route```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/route) modules interface with external devices, including Max internal routing, MIDI, OSC, and Euroracks. 

- [```transform```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/transform) modules process signals via different algorithms, including filtering, averaging and smoothing.

- [```utility```](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo/tree/main/patchers/utility) modules can handle auxiliary functions, such as mixing, visualising and recording input data.

### List & Multichannel

Modules can stream both control (data) and audio signals. The latter can be distinguished in their name by the appended ```~``` (tilde) symbol. As each device permits a different set of input channels, each module is designed to automatically adapt to the number of input channels. 

* Please note that Max’s DSP engine has to be refreshed (turned off and on) to update the number of channels.

### Abstractions & Bpatchers

Users can combine two different methods of patching:

1. *Bpatchers* (with GUI exposed): Each module is instantiated as bpatchers, which exposes parameters in a graphical user interface.

2. *Abstractions* (with objects exposed): Each module is instantiated in the main patcher window as an abstraction, where the main parameters can be modified using the appropriate message (e.g. ```mute 1```).

### Preset

Parameters in each GUI is “bound" to a ```pattr``` object, using a consistent namespace  in the GUI, abstraction and help files. This means that the ```preset``` object can be used in conjunction with ```pattrstorage``` to save and recall a snapshot of all parameters in a patcher window.

## Installation

Search for ```modulo``` in the Max Package Manager or find it under the Featured Package section. 

If you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, you can clone this repo via Terminal using the following commands:

	cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo

Alternatively, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/modulo). After decompressing the zip archive, place the resulting folder in the Max search path, preferably in ```Max > Packages```:

* `~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages`
